This is a library for abstracting away joystick communication on Linux. There's not much here yet, but I plan to add a lot.

TODO:
- [x] Scan for avalilable controllers
- [ ] Support for Wii U Pro Controller
- [ ] Support for Logitech F310
- [ ] Support for PS4 Controller
- [ ] Support for Xbox Controllers
- [ ] Ability to switch between Nintendo button layout, Xbox button layout, and PlayStation symbols
- [ ] OS X Support
- [ ] Windows Support (Probably not anytime soon)

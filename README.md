- [x] Function to prompt the user to select their controller
- [x] Ability to easily keep track of already bound controllers
- [x] Support for Wii U Pro Controller
- [ ] Support for Logitech F310
- [ ] Support for PS4 Controller
- [ ] Support for Xbox Controllers

- [ ] OS X Support
- [ ] Windows Support (Probably not anytime soon)
